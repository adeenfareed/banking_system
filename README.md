<h3 align="left">This project demonstrates a bank’s network infrastructure designed and simulated using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network connects multiple departments  including Accounts, Management, and Customer Service through an integrated system of routers, switches, and servers.<br><br>The configuration implements key networking concepts such as:<br><br>VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) for departmental segmentation and traffic isolation<br><br>DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) for automated IP address assignment<br><br>DNS (Domain Name System) for internal name resolution<br><br>ACLs (Access Control Lists) to enforce security and restrict unauthorized access<br><br>This setup ensures secure, efficient, and reliable communication across all departments, simulating a real-world enterprise banking environment with controlled access and smooth data flow.</h3>
